# Simple Weather App (Android)

A native Android application built over a day that returns data from Yahoo! and parses the JSON into viewable results.
The application contains a main ListView that allows the user to display several locations at anyone time, although the 
current picture is very limited and requires a proper Enum to be used to assign the correct picture to the correct weather.

The app works although it has some features missing and I aim to finish this application adding a sharedReference to save 
the cities the user picks; an Enum to ensure the correct picture is displayed; and a widget for the homescreen.
